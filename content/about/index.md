I'm currently a final-year undergraduate student in the School of Computer Science and Technology, @[Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/), and a research intern @[HKU NLP](https://hkunlp.github.io/), supervised by [Tao Yu](https://taoyds.github.io/). Also I'm an incoming master @[Fudan DISC](http://www.fudan-disc.com/), will be supervised by [Zhongyu Wei](https://taoyds.github.io/). Previously, I joined in the NLP group in BIT, advised by [Xin Xin](https://xxin1984.github.io/). I come from Chongqing, China, a beautiful city ​​surrounded by mountains and rivers.

My main research interest is Natural Language Processing. I care about multimodality in NLP area, especially the intersection bewteen text and code, vision, speech etc. Recently, I’ve focused on code generation and how to give a reliable evaluation, working with a group of wonderful people @[HKU NLP](https://hkunlp.github.io/).
